This is a simple Rust program that does basic, Verlet integration on a single particle.  The intention is to give me a vehicle to learn the basics of the Rust programming language, remind myself of some basic kinematic principles, and more or less to give me something to do.

I engaged one of my closest friends, ChatGPT, to help me get the basic components in place and to help me understand what the weird symbols in strange places in Rust are doing.

In the future, I'd like to add some visualizations for this in both 2d and 3d.  But baby steps...
